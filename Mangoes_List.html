        and fish. However, Devgad is majorly known for its unadulterated Alphonso mango cultivation. Alphonso is 
        one of the most expensive as well as finest varieties of mangoes. The mangoes are grown mainly in the

         referred to as ‘Hapus’ in Maharashtra and Gujarat states. Also, they are used to make sweets, 
         smoothies, candies and mango drinks. The mango can also be consumed directly after ripe and a favorite
